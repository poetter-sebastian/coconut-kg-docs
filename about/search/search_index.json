The database contains the data in several parts. The largest part is in sourceNaturalProducts. We have exported this as json for better processing. Using a self created schema, we set up several rules to transform the json data into RDF data. For the transformation we used eccenca corporate memory The schema can be found at http://coconut-kg.aksw.org/dataset/index.html Schema creation process Some properties occur multiple times in a original Coconut record. This is probably due to the fact that Coconut has been created from multiple datasets. We decided not to transfer these duplications into our ontology, as far as they are visible to us. We used the command line tool jq to verify the duplicates. For example to validate if there is no simpleInchi and inchi which doesn't share the same information we used: jq 'select(.simpleInchi != .uniqueNaturalProduct.inchi)' sourceNaturalProduct.jsonl List of duplicates: $oid and $oid totalAtomNumber and total_atom_number simpleInchi and inchi simpleInchiKey and inchikey We have decided to merge citation and citationDOI to citationDOI . synonyms and uniqueNaturalProduct.synonyms will also be merged. Since in many cases there is no information in the property continent and in geoLocation there is information about the origin, we decided to keep only geoLocation . We also used the command line tool jq to find out which properties do not contain values. For example with the following command: jq '.uniqueNaturalProduct.collection | select(length > 0)' sourceNaturalProduct.jsonl List of empty properties: allTaxa collection allWikidataIds taxid allChemClassifications","title":"Extraction process"},{"location":"extraction/#extraction-process","text":"COCONUT provides the data as MongoDB dump.

You can query the COCONUT[KG] online with a SPARQL endpoint. SPARQL endpoint At http://coconut-kg.aksw.org/sparql you'll find a SPARQL endpoint. Both back-end and front-end are provided by OpenLink Virtuoso. The back-end serves a SPARQL engine. In the front-end we find a HTTP/SPARQL server with nginx overlay. NOTE: Before using the SPARQL endpoint we recommend to read this documentation first SPARQL endpoint details Endpoint type The SPARQL enpoint is provided by the OpenLink Software Virtuoso Rates and limitations You can make a limited number of connections. The settings can be seen below: ResultSetMaxRows = 25000 MaxQueryExecutionTime = 600 (seconds) MaxQueryCostEstimationTime = 400 (seconds) Connection limit = 10 (parallel connections per IP address ATTENTION : The result size is currently limited to 25000 rows.
