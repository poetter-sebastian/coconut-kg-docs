## Current dataset issues</h4>

 - The taxonomy data is currently not yet satisfactory.
 - Some properties might have some "urn:instance ..." entries, which equals no data.

## Planned future updates

 - In-depth refinement of the taxonomy data.
 - Remove empty properties/properties that falsely hold automated data(currently: taxonomyReferenceObjects, all textTaxa that simply say "notax")
 - Further improve the ontology with input from chemists and biologists.
