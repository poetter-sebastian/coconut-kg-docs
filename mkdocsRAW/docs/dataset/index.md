**Triples**: The data was stored as RDF triples. A triple consists of subject, predicate and object.

**Entities**: In this context, an entity is a chemical compound.

**Object properties**: Are used to connect classes. *coco:hasDescriptors* is an example for an object property.

**Data properties**: Are used to add attributes to classes. *coco:molecularWeight* is an example for a data property.

**Classes**: They are used to classify a resource. In COCONUT[KG] *coco:Geolocation* would be a class.
